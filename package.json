  "description": "I am making an app where we can watch  the movies, reviews of audience what they think of that movie and their box office collections. Trending movies over the month and india's top gross collection movies in indian history.\r Key Features:\r i will have on search where we can search the movie. where we can watch the movie collection. below the movie we will have comment section. In home page i will have trending movies. It will also suggest you movies according to your mood.\r Tech stack:\r For the frontend, I suggest using React.js with Redux Toolkit for state management, styled with Tailwind CSS for a responsive design. we can integrate routing with React Router and make API calls using Axios. For backend, Node.js with Express.js would be an excellent choice, JWT can handle authentication, and Prisma can be used for ORM. For real-time features, Socket.io can be integrated. You can deploy with Docker for containerization, and host the frontend on Netlify or Vercel, while the backend can go on AWS or Heroku.\r Why This Project:\r As most of the time we really dont know is that movie is really good or just overhyped. As we see the over promotion by the movie creators and public relations.so this app may give you the real reviews of movie. A lot of time media fake the collections of movie, but year we can see real collections of the movie. watching movies are stress relief and entertainment then why not watch worthfull movie who really deserve the credits.",
